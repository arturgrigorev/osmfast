  "description": "The network command exports the OSM road network as a graph structure suitable for network analysis, routing algorithms, or visualization in graph tools.\n\nThe graph includes:\n- Nodes at intersections and road endpoints\n- Edges representing road segments\n- Edge weights for distance and travel time\n- Road attributes on edges",

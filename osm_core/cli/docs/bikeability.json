  "summary": "Calculate bikeability score for an area",
  "description": "The bikeability command analyzes cycling infrastructure and calculates a comprehensive bikeability score (0-100). It evaluates:\n\n- Dedicated infrastructure (cycleways, bike lanes, bike roads/Fahrradstrassen)\n- Intersection safety (bike-car crossing danger analysis)\n- Traffic separation (physical separation from car traffic)\n- Road quality (surface types)\n- Network connectivity (connected cycling routes)\n- Bike facilities (parking, rental, repair stations)\n- Traffic calming (low-speed streets, speed limits)\n\nThe analysis considers:\n- Contraflow cycling allowances\n- Segregated paths\n- Signalized bike crossings\n- Dangerous vs safe intersections where bike routes cross car roads\n\nReturns a grade (A+ to F) with detailed breakdown.",

  "summary": "Calculate shortest/fastest path between two points",
  "description": "The route command finds the optimal path between two points using Dijkstra's algorithm on the OSM road network. It supports different travel modes with appropriate speed limits and access restrictions.\n\nThe output includes the route geometry, total distance, and estimated travel time.",

  "description": "The roads command extracts the road network from an OSM file with comprehensive attributes:\n\n- Road classification (primary, secondary, residential, etc.)\n- Road name and reference numbers\n- Speed limits (tagged or estimated from road type)\n- Surface type and smoothness\n- Lane count and lane-kilometers\n- One-way restrictions\n- Length, sinuosity, and bearing\n- Infrastructure flags (sidewalk, lighting, bridges, tunnels)\n\nSupports filtering by road hierarchy levels and infrastructure type.",
